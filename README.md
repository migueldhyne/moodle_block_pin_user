## Overview

The **Pin User Block** plugin displays customizable badges next to user names on a Moodle course participants page. These badges are based on profile fields defined in the site administration and can be conditionally shown according to configurable rules.

- **Customizable deployment conditions:**  
  - Field is empty / not empty  
  - Equals / contains / does not contain a given value  
- **Custom text and background colors** for each badge  
- **Dynamic CSS loading** based on configuration  
- **Access restricted** to users with the `moodle/course:manageactivities` capability (typically teachers)
